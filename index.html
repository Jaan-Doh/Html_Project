                Since our wheels are uniquely square, you cannot use traditional rim brakes. Hence, our 'Square Wheels' are fitted with powerful matching coloured disk brakes. In fact!, the brakes are so powerful they will enable you to stop your bike on the very point of any one of the 'Sqaure Wheels'<br><br>
                <b>Please Note:</b> The matching coloured brakes are optional, at extra cost. Standard Black brakes are fitted by deafult.
